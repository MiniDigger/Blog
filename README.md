# Blog

This is my blog, or well, the source code for it.  
It's written in nuxt 3, while it is still in beta and barely works...  
It's also my first vue3/composition api project (I think I hate the composition api)  
Only cool thing about this project is that is uses directus for data storage, a nice headless cms you should totally check out for all your database managing needs!
